# Audio over Wifi with Gaussian noise and a Wiener filter to recover the signal
With this setup and a couple of MKR1000 micro-controllers you can send an audio signal from one PC to another via Serial. Noise is added to the PCM signals at the receiver, to be recovered with a Wiener filter. It is intended as an educational platform to teach signal recovery via stochastic metods 

## Structure:
<ul>
  <li>matlab: contains old files that students will load onto their workspaces</li>
  <li>arduino: sketches for emitter and receiver microcontroller boards</li>
  <li>documentation: course files and old attempts </li>
  <li>python: code for the communication  </li>
</ul>
